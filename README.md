Choosing the right ruby gemstone is crucial for experiencing its full benefits. Always opt for a natural, untreated ruby with vibrant red color, high clarity, and good luster. Burmese and Mozambique rubies are considered among the best in quality. The gemstone should ideally be set in gold or copper, and its weight must match the recommendations of an experienced astrologer based on your birth chart. Before wearing, it should be energized through proper Vedic rituals and worn on the ring finger of the right hand, preferably on a Sunday morning during the Sunâ€™s hora. Maintenance is equally important to retain its energy and beauty. Clean the ruby regularly with mild soap, soft brush, and lukewarm water. Avoid exposing it to harsh chemicals, extreme heat, or rough handling to prevent scratches or damage. Store it separately in a soft cloth pouch when not in use. With proper selection, wearing, and care, a ruby can be a lifelong source of health, wealth, and spiritual growth.
